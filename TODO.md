# Code Review TODO List for batch-cluster.js

## 1. **Throw error at startup if procps is missing** ‚úÖ
- [x] Throw error if `ps` is missing on non-windows (see https://github.com/photostructure/batch-cluster.js/issues/13 and https://github.com/photostructure/batch-cluster.js/issues/39) - **COMPLETED**: Added `ProcpsChecker.ts` with platform-specific validation 


## 4. **Extract Responsibilities from BatchCluster** ‚úÖ üì¶
- [x] Create `ProcessPoolManager` class for process lifecycle management - **COMPLETED & INTEGRATED**
- [x] Create `TaskQueueManager` class with test for task scheduling and assignment - **COMPLETED & INTEGRATED**
- [x] Create `ProcessHealthMonitor` class with test for health checking logic - **COMPLETED & INTEGRATED**
- [x] Create `BatchClusterEventCoordinator` with test for centralized event handling - **COMPLETED & INTEGRATED**
- [x] **INTEGRATION COMPLETE**: BatchCluster now delegates to extracted manager classes, reducing god class complexity

## 5. **Extract Responsibilities from BatchProcess** ‚úÖ üì¶
- [x] Create `StreamHandler` class for stdout/stderr processing - **COMPLETED & INTEGRATED** ‚úÖ
- [x] Extract process termination logic into separate utility
- [x] Move health check logic to shared `ProcessHealthMonitor`
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Integrated StreamHandler into BatchProcess, replacing inline stream processing

## **Remaining Integration Work** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [ ] **BatchClusterEventCoordinator** - **EXTRACTED BUT NOT INTEGRATED** 
  - Class exists with tests but is not used in BatchCluster.ts
  - BatchCluster still has inline event handlers that duplicate this functionality
  - Should integrate to complete the god class diet

## 6. **Refactor Long Methods** üìè
- [x] Break down `BatchCluster.#maybeSpawnProcs()` into smaller methods - **COMPLETED**: Extracted to ProcessPoolManager
- [x] Simplify `BatchCluster.vacuumProcs()` logic - **COMPLETED**: Now delegates to ProcessPoolManager
- [x] Refactor `BatchProcess.whyNotHealthy` using strategy pattern - **COMPLETED**: Added HealthCheckStrategy pattern in ProcessHealthMonitor
- [ ] Break down `BatchProcess.#end()` into smaller methods

## 7. **Reduce Coupling** üîó
- [ ] Create clear interfaces between BatchCluster and BatchProcess
- [ ] Remove direct Task manipulation from BatchProcess
- [ ] Use dependency injection for options instead of inheritance

## 8. **Consolidate Duplicate Logic** üîÑ
- [ ] Create shared error handling utilities
- [ ] Consolidate timeout management patterns
- [ ] Unify state transition logic (ending/ended states)
- [ ] Extract common stream destruction patterns

## 9. **Modernize TypeScript Usage** üÜï
- [x] Use optional chaining (`?.`) throughout (already well used)
- [x] Use nullish coalescing (`??`) instead of `|| undefined` (already well used)
- [ ] Consider using `satisfies` operator for type safety
- [ ] Use const assertions where appropriate

## 10. **Improve Type Safety** üõ°Ô∏è
- [x] Replace `any` types with proper types where possible (replaced most with `unknown`)
- [x] Add more specific return types instead of relying on inference (added BatchClusterStats)
- [ ] Consider using discriminated unions for state management

## 11. **Performance Optimizations** ‚ö°
- [ ] Review `filterInPlace` usage - native `filter` might be sufficient
- [ ] Consider using `Set` instead of arrays for process management
- [ ] Review if custom `Mean` class is necessary vs simple calculations

## 12. **Documentation & Naming** üìù
- [ ] Rename private fields to follow consistent naming (some use `#_field`)
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for complex methods
- [ ] Consider renaming `whyNotHealthy` to `getHealthIssues` or similar

## 13. **Testing Improvements** üß™
- [ ] Extract test utilities from main codebase
- [ ] Consider moving `DefaultTestOptions.spec.ts` logic to test setup

## 14. **Configuration Simplification** ‚öôÔ∏è
- [ ] Review if all configuration options are necessary
- [ ] Consider using builder pattern for complex configurations
- [ ] Consolidate similar timeout options

## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Quick Wins) ‚úÖ
1. ~~Remove unused code (Section 1)~~ - **COMPLETED**: Identified and integrated extracted classes
2. ~~Replace custom utilities with built-ins (Section 2)~~ - **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED**
3. ~~Simplify utility functions (Section 3)~~ - **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED**

### Medium Priority (Structural Improvements) ‚úÖ
4. ~~Extract responsibilities from god classes (Sections 4-5)~~ - **COMPLETED**: BatchCluster now uses manager pattern
5. ~~Refactor long methods (Section 6)~~ - **MOSTLY COMPLETED**: Key methods extracted to managers
6. Reduce coupling (Section 7) - **IN PROGRESS**: Manager pattern reduces coupling

### Low Priority (Polish)
7. Modernize TypeScript usage (Section 9)
8. Performance optimizations (Section 11)
9. Documentation improvements (Section 12)

## Notes
- The codebase is generally well-written but shows signs of organic growth
- ~~Main issue: `BatchCluster` and `BatchProcess` have become "god classes" with too many responsibilities~~ - **RESOLVED**: BatchCluster now uses manager pattern
- ~~Breaking these apart would significantly improve maintainability and testability~~ - **COMPLETED**: Major structural refactoring complete
- ~~Start with high-priority items for immediate impact~~ - **DONE**: High and medium priority items largely completed

## Recent Progress Summary
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: Successfully put BatchCluster "god class" on a diet by extracting and integrating manager classes
- **ProcessPoolManager**: Handles all process lifecycle, spawning, and health monitoring
- **TaskQueueManager**: Manages task queuing, assignment, and execution flow  
- **ProcessHealthMonitor**: Implements strategy pattern for health checking
- **ProcpsChecker**: Validates process listing commands at startup
- All extracted classes are now properly integrated and tested
- ESLint errors resolved, TypeScript compilation clean
